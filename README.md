Back-end of a turn based stealth game, made for fun and practice. Currently works as a rudimentary command line game.

Units are controlled by players or by AI, and come in classes with seperate abilities and attributes.  The objective for the Thieves is to take the treasure from the Guards and escape, and the Guards need to eliminate the Thieves.  

Currently implemented:
9 different Units, including Thieves, Guards, Summons
Unit containment structures Roster, Team, and Recruit_Board for Unit management
A Map filled with Tiles, generated randomly or from file
Alters with both permanent and temporary duration
Items with passive effects given to units
Talent tree of talents Units can aquire
